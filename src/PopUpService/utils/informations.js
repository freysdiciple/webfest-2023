        "John Dalton was an English physicist who made several significant discoveries and contributions to science during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.",
        "He is most famous for his development of the Atomic Theory, proposed in the early 1800s. This theory revolutionized the understanding of matter and its composition. Dalton said that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. He suggested that each element is characterized by unique atoms with specific properties, such as mass and chemical behavior. Furthermore, Dalton proposed that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms to form new compounds.",

        "1911 : Ernest Rutherford (british physicist as well) sends alpha particles (Helium nucleus, with a positive charge) on a foil of gold. This experiment shows that atoms are composed of a lot of void (lots of particles go through without scattering) and some particles are scattered/repulsed in the opposite direction, which indicates the presence of a positive charge inside the atom, since same sign charges repulse themselves while opposite charges get attracted.",
        "The atom is now seen as a nucleus with positive charge (the protons) with negative charges  rotating around (the electrons). But part of the mass seems to be missing…"

        "After Ernest Rutherford’s model of the atom, there was still one question that didnt get an answer “Why didnt the positively charged protons in the nucleus repel each other and cause the atom to be unstable?”",
        "To answer this question, Sir James Chadwick, a British physicist, conducted a series of experiments to investigate this puzzle. Chadwick used beryllium and other light elements as targets for alpha particles. He observed that when alpha particles, which were known to be helium nuclei, bombarded the beryllium nucleus, a previously unknown radiation was emitted. This radiation had no charge but was able to penetrate matter more effectively than other known particles.",
        "In 1932, Chadwick concluded that this new radiation was composed of particles that were about the same mass as protons but carried no electric charge. He named these particles 'neutrons' due to their neutral nature. He received the Nobel prize in 1935 for this discovery."

        "In the mid-20th century, physicists were studying the properties of cosmic rays and experimenting with particle accelerators. They observed many new particles, collectively called hadrons, which were found to be composed of even smaller constituents.",
        "In the early 1960s, American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and Israeli physicists Yuval Ne'eman independently proposed the Eightfold Way, which organized hadrons into groups based on their properties. Gell-Mann introduced the concept of 'quarks' as fundamental building blocks to explain the patterns observed in the hadron classification.",
        "In 1964, Gell-Mann and George Zweig, an American physicist, independently developed the quark model to explain the structure of hadrons. They proposed that hadrons are made up of three smaller particles called quarks, which come in different 'flavors': up, down, and strange.",
        "The existence of quarks was supported by scattering experiments conducted by physicists, including Richard Feynman , an American physicist ,in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These experiments provided evidence for the point-like substructure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) and indicated that they were composed of quarks.",
        "In the early 1970s, physicists discovered that the strong force, responsible for binding quarks together inside hadrons, was a fundamental force described by a new theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).",
        "QCD introduced gluons, which are massless particles that mediate the strong force between quarks, analogous to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force between charged particles.",

The Higgs field is associated to the Higgs particle, whose existence was theorized by Robert Brout (belgian physicist with american origin), François Englert (belgian physicist) and Peter Higgs (british physicist). The Higgs particle was finally discovered at CERN in 2012, by ATLAS and CMS experiments in LHC. This was the missing piece of the Standard Model puzzle, but may not be the end of the story…",
